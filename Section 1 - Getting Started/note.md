What is Next.js?
- **React Framework:** Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
- **Feature-Rich:** It provides a set of features like automatic code splitting, optimized performance, and a built-in routing system, making it easier to build scalable and high-performance web applications.

Key Features and Benefits:
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js allows you to render pages on the server side, improving performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** You can generate static HTML at build time, which can be served directly by a CDN.
- **API Routes:** Next.js provides a way to create API endpoints within the same codebase as your frontend application.
- **Automatic Code Splitting:** Each page only loads the necessary JavaScript, which improves load times.
- **Built-in CSS and Sass Support:** You can import CSS and Sass files directly into your components.
- **Image Optimization:** Next.js includes an Image component that automatically optimizes images for faster loading.
- **File-based Routing:** Pages are automatically routed based on the file structure in the pages directory.
- **Hot Module Replacement:** During development, changes are applied without a full page reload, making the development process faster.
- **TypeScript Support:** Next.js has built-in TypeScript support, making it easier to work with typed JavaScript.
- **Internationalized Routing:** Built-in support for internationalized routing to handle multiple languages.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Allows you to update static content after the site has been built and deployed.
- **Fast Refresh:** Provides instant feedback on edits made to your React components.
